# .NET and Next.js Platform Profile

## Intent

This profile selects one supported platform so architecture and coding conventions can be concrete. It combines a .NET modular monolith, PostgreSQL, Marten, LiteBus, Aspire local orchestration, and optional Next.js frontends in one repository.

Exact framework and package versions live only in `standards.manifest.json`.

## Agent Summary {#agent-summary}

- Use one bounded-context modular monolith.
- Use Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and WebApi as the four application projects.
- Change Aggregate state only through Aggregate behavior and select the least complex representation that prevents invalid states.
- Use PostgreSQL and Marten as baseline persistence.
- Use LiteBus command and query entry points with one command commit pipeline.
- Use Aspire for local service orchestration.
- Use the manifest-pinned Node.js LTS and pnpm toolchain for TypeScript workspaces.
- Add Next.js frontends only when the product has a web surface.
- Use the controlled shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS v4 baseline for React web frontends and a separate
  platform decision for native frontends.

## Standards

### Apply the complete profile (PROFILE.COMPOSITION.001)

Selecting `dotnet-nextjs` activates every baseline convention listed in this document. Consumers cannot claim the profile while silently omitting an applicable standard.

### Use manifest version pins (PROFILE.VERSIONS.001)

Resolve SDK, framework, NuGet, and npm versions from `standards.manifest.json`. Do not copy a version from prose, an example, package search results, or agent memory.

### Declare replacements (PROFILE.REPLACEMENT.001)

An extension or consumer override may replace a baseline choice only when it names every affected rule ID. Unrelated profile standards remain active.

## Conventions

### Keep the platform profile visible

Consumer `standards.project.json` names `dotnet-nextjs`. The root `AGENTS.md` identifies the .NET solution name, frontend app names, and commands that substitute project placeholders.

### Note known toolchain interactions

The pinned ESLint 10 removed context APIs (for example `context.getFilename()`) that `eslint-plugin-react` still calls during runtime React version detection, so a Next flat config that leaves the React version at `detect` throws `contextOrFilename.getFilename is not a function` until the plugin ships ESLint 10 support. Set a concrete `settings.react.version` in the flat config to skip detection, which is the current workaround and good practice regardless. If a consumer cannot pin the version, hold ESLint at the latest 9.x release until the plugin is compatible. Re-evaluate this note when the pins advance.

## Verification

- Confirm the consumer profile is `dotnet-nextjs`.
- Confirm dependency versions match the manifest.
- Confirm every declared extension exists and its replacements are explicit.
- Confirm project paths match the repository structure convention.
