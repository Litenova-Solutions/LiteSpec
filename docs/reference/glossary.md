# Glossary

## Acceptance criterion

One observable condition owned by a use-case specification. Its stable ID uses `AC-{MODULE}-{USE-CASE}-{NN}`. A criterion describes required behavior; it is not the test implementation.

## Acceptance test

Automated executable evidence for one or more acceptance criteria. The test cites each exact acceptance ID it proves.

## Agent

A software system that can inspect repository context, reason about a bounded task, change authorized artifacts, and run verification. An agent executes within delegated authority and does not own unresolved product or risk decisions.

## Agent-Driven Engineering

The operating model within the Agentic Engineering System in which agents perform substantial engineering execution from approved specifications. People retain decision authority and review responsibility.

## Agent Summary

The anchored short section agents load as Tier 1 context for a task. The full document remains the source when a summary is insufficient.

## Agentic Engineering System

A general system for specifying, building, verifying, releasing, and operating software with agents as active engineering participants. Litenova Solutions authors and uses the standards in this repository as its implementation of the system. It uses Specification-Driven Delivery and Agent-Driven Engineering.

## Aggregate

A cluster of domain objects changed as one transactional consistency boundary. An aggregate protects every invariant that must hold when its transaction commits.

## Aggregate invariant

A rule that must remain true after every transaction that changes one aggregate. `Invariant` means the rule cannot remain temporarily false after commit. IDs use `INV-{MODULE}-{NN}`.

## Aggregate root

The only external mutation entry point for an aggregate. `Root` identifies the object through which the aggregate is changed; it does not mean every domain type inherits from it.

## Aggregate state

The complete lifecycle condition of an aggregate. The engineering system represents it with one abstract `{Aggregate}State` record and one or more sealed state records.

## Authorization policy

A policy that decides whether an identified actor may perform an operation on a specific target. Authentication proves identity; authorization decides permitted behavior.

## Command

An Application message that may change business state. One top-level Command owns one command pipeline and one transaction commit.

## Convention

A default name, location, file shape, or implementation pattern. A consumer may replace a convention through one explicit local convention.

## Decision Evidence

An optional research record used when provider approval, legal review, security analysis, financial assumptions, or other external facts affect a decision. Normal evidence remains inside the decision record; create a separate record only when the investigation needs its own owner and lifecycle.

## Derived artifact

A committed application file produced deterministically from an authored source. OpenAPI and generated TypeScript API types are derived artifacts.

## Domain

The area of real-world knowledge, language, rules, state, and behavior modeled by the software. Orders and refund policy belong to the domain; HTTP routing and database sessions are technical mechanisms. The capitalized `Domain` project is the code layer that implements domain types.

## Domain event

An immutable, package-free Domain record describing a completed fact inside the bounded context.

## Domain policy

An accepted business rule that is not owned by one aggregate invariant. `Domain` places the policy in business behavior. `Policy` means the rule selects, permits, limits, or requires behavior from known facts. IDs use `POL-{POLICY}-{NN}`.

## End-to-end flow

A connection of use cases from an accepted starting condition to one observable product outcome across every required system boundary. It may include actor choices, system work, waiting, failures, and recovery.

## End-to-end test

An automated test that verifies one complete end-to-end flow through deployed public boundaries and required infrastructure. IDs use `E2E-{FLOW}-{NN}`.

## Engineering system

A connected set of decisions, specifications, standards, implementation conventions, verification, operating controls, and release practices. `System` describes how the parts constrain and support one another; it is not a runtime framework.

## Entry point

A path through which an actor or system invokes or observes a use case, such as an HTTP API, web application, webhook, Worker trigger, or administrative interface.

## Event

An immutable statement that a relevant fact completed. Event names use past tense, such as `OrderConfirmed`.

## Event reaction

Behavior caused by an event. A reaction may be implemented by an event handler, workflow orchestrator, projection, or scheduled job. The term describes causality without prescribing a class suffix.

## Extension

A conditional standards bundle selected in `standards.project.json`. Project-scoped extensions apply when selected. Local extensions apply only to allowed specification kinds that list them.

## Integration event

A versioned message contract delivered outside the bounded context.

## Module

A cohesive area of the domain used to organize language, use cases, aggregates, code, and ownership. A module is not automatically an assembly, deployment unit, transaction boundary, or aggregate.

## Normative

Required for a conforming consumer. Content under a `Standards` section is normative.

## Operating limit

An enforced, tested, or supported operating boundary, or an alert threshold that requires operator action.

## Persistence constraint

A rule enforced by stored-data infrastructure, such as uniqueness, a required relationship, or a bounded value. Persistence means durable storage; constraint means the store rejects an invalid representation.

## Platform profile

A supported combination of architecture, frameworks, project layout, and baseline conventions. Version 1 contains the `dotnet-nextjs` profile.

## Primary release flow

The end-to-end flow selected as the first deployed product outcome that gates application v1. `Primary` identifies priority. `Release` means the flow must work for the immutable artifact being evaluated.

## Product

The software capability offered to users together with its supported operating boundary, outcomes, exclusions, and external commitments. Product does not mean only the frontend application.

## Projection

A process that derives a Read Model from authoritative facts. Its delivery is atomic, durable, or rebuildable when the Read Model is required behavior.

## Query

An Application message that reads a Read Model without changing business state.

## Read Model

Data shaped for a Query without requiring aggregate loading or mutation.

## Release Record

The immutable record for one release artifact. It captures build, test, deployment, restore, rollback, diagnostics, smoke-test, operating-limit, and runbook evidence.

## Repository

A Domain-owned port that loads and stages complete aggregates. It does not expose general queries or commit a transaction.

## Risk

A use-case metadata value that adds specification and verification for authorization, money, sensitive data, irreversible behavior, concurrency, durable delivery, or availability.

## Rule ID

A canonical uppercase dotted identifier such as `APP.COMMAND.001` used by standards overrides, extensions, decisions, conflict reports, and review within one standards release.

## Specification

An approved, versioned statement of required behavior or constraint. A specification remains in the repository after one prompt, agent session, or implementation task ends.

## Specification-Driven Delivery

The delivery approach within the Agentic Engineering System in which approved specifications select work and define completion. Prompts and tickets may initiate work, but the owning specification records approved behavior.

## Specification Metadata

The JSON block at the start of a structured specification. It identifies the document kind, ID, authority, owner, review date, and kind-specific implementation data.

## Standards override

A consumer replacement for a normative rule. It names the rule ID and an accepted project decision in `standards.project.json`.

## Use case

One independently testable actor or system goal implemented as one top-level Command or Query operation.

## Validation rule

A rule that checks the shape, format, or bounded value of a Command or Query before business behavior runs.

## Value Object

An immutable Domain type defined by its values and rules rather than an independent identity.

## Workflow

System-controlled progress across a transaction or time boundary. A workflow records durable state, awaited events, issued Commands, retry or idempotency behavior, and recovery when those concerns apply.

## Workflow orchestrator

The component that persists and advances a durable workflow. `Orchestrator` means it selects the next action rather than performing every action itself. Industry mappings include Process Manager and orchestration-based Saga.

## Workflow rule

A rule that controls when a workflow advances, waits, retries, compensates, fails, completes, or requires operator action.
