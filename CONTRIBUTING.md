# Contributing

Changes use a branch and pull request against `main`. Direct pushes to `main` are outside the release process.

## Documentation contract

Each topic document begins with `Intent` and separates required `Standards` from replaceable `Conventions`. Actionable standards use a unique canonical rule ID with the human title first.

Keep one canonical source for each rule, package version, extension, and upgrade requirement. Link instead of copying.

## Required review

Before requesting review:

- Inspect changed links and rule IDs.
- Confirm manifest paths and `#agent-summary` anchors exist.
- Confirm extension names match the manifest and consumer template.
- Validate `standards.manifest.json` and `templates/docs/standards.project.json` against their schemas.
- Update the changelog.
- Add an upgrade guide when an existing compliant consumer must change in a post-v1.10.0 release.
- Update document templates when Specification Metadata or required sections change.
- Run `git diff --check`.

The repository ships reference validators for Specification Metadata and controlled React web UI. It has
no generated catalog or application scaffold. Validate JSON shape with the tracked schemas and run both
validators through consumer CI or review tooling.

A change to a UI rule, schema, template, or the UI validator adds or updates a case in
`tools/validate-ui.cases.mjs` in the same change, and `node tools/validate-ui.cases.mjs` passes. A rule
without a passing and a failing case is unverified.

## Normative changes

A new or changed standard includes:

- One canonical rule ID.
- Intent and at least one concrete example.
- Verification that can be performed by an agent, reviewer, compiler, test, or operating check.
- A changelog entry.
- An upgrade note when an existing compliant consumer must change.

A convention states how a consumer may document a local replacement. Do not use a convention to weaken a security, data, or architectural standard.

## Extensions

An extension document contains activation criteria, baseline relationship, agent summary, standards, conventions, dependencies, and verification. It names every baseline rule it replaces.

Do not add a separate extension descriptor or schema. The extension Markdown file is the contract, and the manifest maps its ID to its path, activation scope, and allowed local specification kinds.

## Solo-maintainer review

The maintainer may merge their own pull request after all required checks pass and an AI review examines the complete diff. A second human approval is encouraged when another maintainer is available, but it is not a merge requirement.

Resolve every actionable review comment before merge. Use squash merge unless preserving separate migration commits materially helps review.

## Versioning

- Patch releases make narrow corrections or clarifications.
- Minor releases make a coherent standards evolution, including changes that require consumer migration.
- Major releases replace a substantial part of the supported scope, method, or platform profile.

No release category promises backward compatibility. Prefer one clear current contract over deprecated aliases or retained vocabulary. The changelog and upgrade guide state required consumer work.

Accepted decision records are historical. Add a replacement decision and mark the old record superseded rather than rewriting its outcome.

## Consumer upgrades

For standards releases after v1.10.0, consumers update the pinned standards commit in a dedicated pull
request, read the changelog and applicable upgrade guide, apply required work, and run the complete
application gate set.
