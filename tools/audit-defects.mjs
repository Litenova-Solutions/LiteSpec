        "Nothing accounts for a liability, and it would be a different aggregate if it did. A sold gift card is cash received against a future obligation. It is a contract liability under IFRS 15 and ASC 606. Breakage is recognised in proportion to the pattern of redemptions where the issuer expects to be entitled to it. The references are IFRS 15 B44 to B47 and ASC 606-10-55-46 to 55-49, constrained by 606-10-32-11 to 32-13. It is recognised as a liability rather than revenue where unclaimed-property law obliges the issuer to remit it. A promotional code has none of that, because no cash was received. Nothing in [finance](../../finance/README.md) knows vouchers exist, and `VoucherBatchIssuedEvent` reaches no ledger. The batch does not record whether its vouchers were sold or given away. That fact decides whether there is a liability at all."],
