// Collects what every aggregate root owns, references, is referenced by, raises,
// and reacts to into one cross-reference map, so a reader can answer what moving
// or removing a root breaks without opening 63 pages.
//
// Reads: every `kind: aggregate` page and every `kind: module` page under
// `docs/domain/modules/`, and the module enumeration in
// `docs/domain/modules/README.md`.
//
// Writes: `docs/domain/aggregate-map.md`.
//
//   node standards/tools/audit-aggregates.mjs [consumerRoot]           reports the counts
//   node standards/tools/audit-aggregates.mjs [consumerRoot] --check   refuses a stale page
//   node standards/tools/audit-aggregates.mjs [consumerRoot] --fix     writes the page
//
// `Owns` and `References by ID` come from each aggregate page's Ownership table.
// `Referenced by` inverts that column across every root: a token naming another
// root's identity is matched to the root its name begins with, so
// `EventCapacityHoldId` names `EventCapacity`. `Events raised` comes from the
// page's Events table. `Reacts to` comes from the module page's
// `Events and event reactions` table, and a module-level reaction is carried by
// every root the module owns.
//
// A cell that would run past the controlled-prose bound keeps a short traceable
// phrase and the row's link to the source page. The prose measures are imported
// from the sibling `prose.mjs` so the map proves its own output.
