# Changelog

## v1.2.0

- Replaced structural capability terminology with subject terminology across ADDD, architecture, templates, and layer conventions.
- Defined a subject as the cross-layer business and navigation boundary that groups one or more related use cases, with one primary aggregate root for state-changing behavior and none for read-only behavior.
- Kept `AggregateRoot<TId>` as the runtime consistency and mutation boundary, and prohibited `Subject`, `ISubject`, and `SubjectRoot` runtime abstractions.
- Replaced the capability specification template with the subject specification template, documented subject and page routing metadata, and added the v1.2 consumer migration guide.
- Replaced `ADDD.CAPABILITY.001` with `ADDD.SUBJECT.001` and `ARCH.CAPABILITIES.001` with `ARCH.SUBJECTS.001`.
- Required command and query results, handlers, and validators to include their architectural role in the type and file name.
- Replaced ambiguous `{Concept}` and `Summary` patterns with `{DomainType}`, `{BusinessTerm}`, `{BusinessRule}`, and `{UseCase}QueryResultItem` patterns.
- Required HTTP transport DTOs and mapping classes to use the explicit `RequestModel`, `ResponseModel`, and `ApiMappings` suffixes.

## v1.1.0

- Added code and documentation consistency checks for business names, capability and use-case paths, acceptance IDs, generated API contracts, duplicate contracts, and removed entry points.
- Added document ownership, authority, freshness, canonical-source, and implementation-evidence requirements for consumer documentation.
- Added product and operating context fields to the product brief for commercial, legal, provider, money, risk, audit, and support constraints.
